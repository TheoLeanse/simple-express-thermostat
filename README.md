## Thermostat

Simple Express app allowing a user to adjust their temperature based on local weather, built with JS, Jasmine, Express and Grunt before being deployed to Heroku.

### Testing

`$ grunt jasmine` to run JS unit tests.

For config, see GruntFile and jasmine.json

Much more convenient than having to tab to a browser to run the SpecRunner, and I prefer installing via npm (but the grunt-contrib-jasmine package outputs a custom SpecRunner in case of booboos).
